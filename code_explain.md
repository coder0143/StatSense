This code is a comprehensive implementation of a machine learning experiment tracking system using PyTorch and Streamlit. It consists of three main files: `app.py`, `TorchTrack.py`, and `model.py`. Below is a detailed explanation of each file and its components to help you explain it to a faculty member during a review.

---

### **1. `app.py`: Streamlit Application for Experiment Visualization**
This file is a Streamlit-based web application that visualizes the results of machine learning experiments stored in a `data.json` file.

#### **Key Components:**
1. **`load_experiment_data()` Function:**
   - Loads experiment data from `data.json`.
   - Converts the JSON data into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
   - Handles errors gracefully using `try-except` blocks.

2. **`main()` Function:**
   - Sets up the Streamlit app with a title (`TorchTrack Experiment Tracker`).
   - Loads and displays the experiment data in a sorted table (sorted by a performance metric like `accuracy` or `r2_score`).
   - Visualizes epoch-wise performance (loss and accuracy) using line charts for each experiment.
   - Provides an AI-powered analysis sidebar using the `ollama` library to generate:
     - Model performance analysis.
     - Architecture recommendations.
     - Training optimization suggestions.

3. **AI Analysis Sidebar:**
   - Uses the `ollama.chat()` function to interact with a language model (`llama3.2`) for generating insights.
   - Displays the responses in expandable sections for better user experience.

### **2. `TorchTrack.py`: Experiment Tracking Utility**
This file defines a `TorchTrack` class that handles logging and managing experiment data.

#### **Key Components:**
1. **`__init__()` Method:**
   - Initializes the experiment tracker with a name and ensures the `data.json` file exists.

2. **`_initialize_data_file()` Method:**
   - Creates or resets the `data.json` file to store experiment data.

3. **`clean_previous_data()` Method:**
   - Clears previous experiment data from `data.json` and resets epoch data.

4. **`log_epoch()` Method:**
   - Logs loss and accuracy values for each epoch during training.

5. **`log()` Method:**
   - Logs the final experiment data (hyperparameters, metrics, and epoch data) to `data.json`.

### **3. `model.py`: Machine Learning Model Implementation**
This file implements a PyTorch-based neural network for binary classification on the Breast Cancer dataset.

#### **Key Components:**
1. **`BreastCancerNet` Class:**
   - Defines a feedforward neural network with configurable hidden layers.
   - Uses ReLU activation for hidden layers and Sigmoid activation for the output layer.

2. **`prepare_data()` Function:**
   - Loads the Breast Cancer dataset.
   - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
   - Scales the features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Converts the data into PyTorch tensors.

3. **`train_model()` Function:**
   - Trains the `BreastCancerNet` model using the provided hyperparameters.
   - Logs epoch-wise loss and accuracy using the `TorchTrack` class.
   - Logs the final experiment results (hyperparameters and metrics) to `data.json`.

4. **`main()` Function:**
   - Prepares the dataset and defines multiple hyperparameter configurations.
   - Runs experiments with different configurations and logs the results.

### **Workflow Overview:**
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The `prepare_data()` function loads and preprocesses the Breast Cancer dataset.

2. **Model Training:**
   - The `train_model()` function trains the model using different hyperparameter configurations.
   - The `TorchTrack` class logs the experiment data (hyperparameters, metrics, and epoch-wise performance).

3. **Experiment Visualization:**
   - The `app.py` file loads the logged data from `data.json` and visualizes it using Streamlit.
   - It provides interactive charts and AI-generated insights for better analysis.

### **Key Features:**
1. **Experiment Tracking:**
   - Logs hyperparameters, metrics, and epoch-wise performance for each experiment.
   - Stores data in a JSON file for persistence.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Displays experiment results in a sorted table.
   - Visualizes loss and accuracy trends over epochs using line charts.

3. **AI-Powered Analysis:**
   - Provides detailed analysis, architecture recommendations, and training optimization suggestions using a language model.

4. **Reproducibility:**
   - Uses random seeds for reproducibility across experiments.

5. **Scalability:**
   - Supports multiple hyperparameter configurations and experiments.
